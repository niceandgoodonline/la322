        • Feels strong the whole way -- feeling strong in Act1 is just "not struggling" to me. <br>
        • As soon as you get Onslaught on kill and Gale force you are ZOOMING. <br>
        • Update your bow regularly with essences or physical recipe<button onclick="toggleRecipeImage()">Toggle Image</button>.

    <h2> Divine Vessels: </h2>
        • First was Freeze Immune for Brine King (Waterways, yellow, tier 8) <br>
        • Second was Burning Ground Immune for Abbarath (Summit, yellow, tier 9) <br>
        • Third was Chill Effect -50% for Brine King (Coves, red, tier 11) <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2> Unique Gloves That Are Fun/Good For Mapping: </h2>
    <a href=https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Shadows_and_Dust>Shadows and Dust</a> <br>
        • Gives: Crit, mana leech, rampage. <br>
        • Strat: Get rampage, go fast, never lose rampage, go fast kill. rampage. <br><br>
    
    <a href=https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Null_and_Void>Null and Void</a> <br>
        • Gives: Life/Str, pseudo ailment removal, limited phys immunity, rampage. <br>
        • Strat: Get rampage, go fast, never lose rampage, go fast kill. rampage. <br><br>
    
    <a href=https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Tanu_Ahi>Tanu Ahi</a> <br>
        • Gives: Attack speed, life leech, Adrenaline & Onslaught on lifeleech (basically all the time).<br>
        • Strat: Use with a source of self damage like blood rage, lifetap, or the mastery which makes 30% of mana costs spend life instead. <br><br>

    <a href=https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Kaom%27s_Spirit>Kaom's Spirit</a> <br>
        Gives: Life, fire res, life leech, Rage instead of life regen.<br>
        Strat: Use it with Voll's Vision (or get a lot of life regen elsewhere) to generate rage.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p> <h2>Attributes</h2>

        • I have high Str and Int in these early league builds to level/quality-flip my gems. <br>
        • You need 111 Int for supports, 155 Int for level 20 Flame Dash. <br>
        • You need 92 Str for level 4 Immortal Call/Berserk, 155 for level 20 Berserk.<br>

        • After flipping gems, I'll probably go 111 Int for supports and fit as much Str as possible when/if I swap to Rage. A benefit of using Tanu Ahi over the Rage setup (besides being cheaper) is its easier to gear for.<br>

        • I will probably buy >20% Quality Berserk and Flame Dash because I am lazy/want to use my weapon swap to get 21/20 or better Lightning Arrow.

    </p>
    <p> <h2>Build From White To Yellow Maps </h2>
    <a href=https://pobb.in/FuDMwcLb73nV> Pob Preview via Pobb.in</a><br>

        <b>*** NOTES ON EARLY MAPS ***</b><br>
        • I got a 6 link 450 DPS thicket bow during the campaign. <br>
        • You will probably need 2-3 more bows on the way to red maps/void stones.<br>
        • It's better to have a 4 or 5 link bow with (significantly) higher dps than the 2nd 6 link.<br>

        • I felt strong so I went crit early while the maxroll guide doesnt transtition to crit until they have a good bow. <br>

        • When you go crit remember to respec the <a href=https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Precise_Technique>Precise Techniques</a> keystone passive as this disables crits.<br>

        • I switched from Chain Support to Returning Projectiles Support in my Lightning Arrow 6 link somewhere before red maps. You should probably just use returning projectiles as soon as you get it as it's useful for clear and single target.<br>
    </p>

    <p> <h2> Build At Red Maps </h2>
    <a href=https://pobb.in/OXwDazEYFljM> Pob Preview via Pobb.in</a><br>

        <b>*** NOTES ON HANDLING RED MAPS ***</b><br>

        • I could clear maps fast with my 450 DPS bow but rares and mechanics with tanky mobs were slowing my progress. If you can't delete monsters/offscreen-everything you'll start dying.<br>

        • I spent 2 div on a 6 link 950 DPS bow. A >700 DPS bow shouldn't be hard to hit with essence on a thicket or spine base if theres nothing to buy on console.<br>

        • I switched from Anger to Vaal Haste when I got the better bow. When you get a decent bow with good elemental rolls on it then Vaal Haste, or just Haste, is better overall for mapping (we use Anger to get easy full Trinity Resonance and flat damage early on). <br>

        • I bought a GG rolled Hyrri's Truth and well rolled Dying Sun during my journey to red maps. I probably should have bought a better bow first.<br>
    </p>

    <p> <h2> Build Immediately After Getting 2 Void Stones </h2>
    <a href=https://pobb.in/vNT6GTloxGc_> Pob Preview via Pobb.in</a><br>

        <b>*** NOTES ON FIGHTING EXARCH AND EATER ***</b><br>
        • I'm not good at the balls phase of exarch. I died 3 times to the ball phase.<br>
        • Exarch took about 3 minutes with 1.5m dps and dying 3 times.<br>

        • No deaths on Eater and I survived some of his moves hitting me.<br>
        • Eater took about 2 minutes on 1.5m dps.<br>

    </p>

    <p><h2> My Next Steps </h2>
        • If I didnt have a decent 6link chest, Dying Sun, Hyrri's Truth by the time I had 2 Void Stones I would prioritize those. (6 link with some life+res highest priority. Dying Sun for better clear. Hyrri's Truth for better single target/going crit)<br>

        • I'm probably going to upgrade my rings, quiver, and belt then switch to either Tanu Ahi or Rage Setup. if you spend ~10div on really good rares in those slots you can probably also fit some MF gear in. With a good bow and either rage, adrenaline, or rampage gloves the journey to HH or mageblood should be smooth.<br>
